## Why are we here?
<!-- .element: class="heading invert" -->

Note:
- Why are we here?
- A contribution day is a get together to do focused work for a project.
- We do not work alone: 2-3 people work on the same issue. Your neighbors. Quick feedback loop.



## <em class="emphasize">Everyone</em> has something to contribute

* We improve the Drupal <em class="emphasize">project</em>, for example:
   * Admin UI and JavaScript Modernisation initiative
   * Media initiative
   * Layout Builder initiative
* We improve <em class="emphasize">drupal.org</em>, for example:
   * Documentation
* We improve the Drupal <em class="emphasize">community</em>, for example:
   * Drupal governance and community discussions

Note:
- We all have a unique and diverse background coming from many different countries, cultures, races, genders and roles.
- You will help those around you working on issues in the project and in the community.
- It does not matter in which role.
- From Drupal core initiatives to sub-systems to individual bug fixes and features.
- We make decisions by consensus after discussion, which makes a contribution day so important.

## <a href="https://www.drupal.org" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-drupal"></i> drupal.org</a>
![drupal.org](images/websites-do.png)

Note:
- Some important URLs to try and remember.
- Commonly referred to as D.O. is the central site for the Drupal community.



## <i class="fa fa-user"></i> register.drupal.org<a href="https://register.drupal.org/user/register" target="_blank">/user/register</a>

Note:
- To make the most of these sites you’ll want to have a d.o account
- If you don’t already have a d.o account lets create one now, and/or update your profile..
- Customise your dashboard.



## <i class="fa fa-drupal"></i> drupal.org<a href="https://drupal.org/association" target="_blank">/association</a>

Note:
- Helps the community with funding, infrastructure, education and more, you should become a member tonight if you aren't already... For as little as 15 USD (EUR).



## <i class="fa fa-users"></i> drupal.org<a href="https://www.drupal.org/community" target="_blank">/community</a>

Note:
- The Drupal community hub.
   - We can contribute to Drupal governance initiatives here including the Community Working Group, Documentation Working Group, Core Governance, Licensing Working Group, Security Working Group, Technical Working Group.
   - The documentation pages around Community and Getting Involved are getting a face lift and this is also a way to contribute.



## <i class="fa fa-book"></i> drupal.org<a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs" target="_blank">/docs</a>
<i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> drupal.org<a href="https://www.drupal.org/documentation" target="_blank">/documentation</a><br />
<i class="fa fa-code"></i><a href="https://api.drupal.org" target="_blank"> api.</a>drupal.org

Note:
- Guides for pretty much everything, highlight /documentation/git
- A vital contribution is through documentation. We are migrating from /documentation to /docs. Older documentation via the link below.
- Allows you to search the complete Drupal Appliaction Programming Interface (API) docs for Drupal 4.6 through 8.3.0. This will become indispensible if you are working on core code or you start developing modules.



## <i class="fa fa-code-fork"></i> drupal.org<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal" target="_blank">/project/drupal</a>

Note:
- Drupal core is located at slash project slash drupal.
- Each module, theme and core itself is located from slash project and the short name of the project. Sometimes the short name does not match the actual title such as "Display Suite".



## <i class="fa fa-bug"></i> drupal.org<a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal">/project/issues/drupal</a>

### Issue Queue

Note:
-Issue queues are essentially the community todo list, all project have them
-it’s where you can point out bugs or suggest improvements, and people can test and fix them
-Show advanced search and explain tags
-Do a filtered search, follow an issue
- priority: critical, major issues
- category: bug report, task, plan, support request, feature request
- status: the life cycle of an issue
- tags: Novice

## Chat
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- Drupal Slack and Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is our primary communication method besides the issue queue.
- Other methods such as RocketChat, Google+ and Gittr have also been used within the community. The de facto standard is now Drupal Slack.
- Nicknames: good to match d.o. username.

## Editor
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

Note:
- An editor allows you to make changes to Drupal code properly.
- At this event we may not able to distribute a robust editor due to software licensing restrictions.
- If you have your own Integrated Development Environment (IDE), that may be better suited, but here are several that can be configured for Drupal.
